    <h2>CINEMATIC</h2>
    <p> This is the signature MAPhoto style, which blends bursts of color with fashion inspired
       lighting to unify you and your environment. Though this is the most difficult style to shoot, 
       our team is trained to create at 
      least one image in this style for each part of your wedding day, and the
       results are perfect as framed wall art for your home.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h2>LIGHT & BRIGHT</h2>
    <p> As Los Angeles wedding photographers, we often shoot couples in well lighted as well 
      as not-well lighted areas. Natural light is a hot topic among folks in the photography 
      industry, and we are able to create this clean, airy,
       and light look for you even when the light is low. This timeless, classic 
       form of photography will never go out of style.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h2>CREATIVE CANDID</h2>
    <p> If you love seeing the emotion from your wedding day, you will resonate deeply with our second style,
       which we create by capturing emotional moments as they unfold before our eyes. Photojournalism is the key
       component to a successful story. Images that are not prompted can give us the best quality foundation for 
       a beautiful album</p>
